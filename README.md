# WindRiskNet
WindRiskNet is a deep learning framework for high-resolution wind field prediction, designed to enhance maritime safety and operational decision-making. Leveraging coarse-resolution weather model outputs (e.g., IFS/ERA5), the system downscales key variables such as 10m wind, gusts, and wave-driving forces using advanced neural architectures. 

Initial case study: the Sydney–Hobart race domain (33°S, 152°E to 43°S, 146°E), with the potential to scale globally for shipping, offshore operations, and marine weather risk modeling.
